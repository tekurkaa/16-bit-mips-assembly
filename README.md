In order to start translating the code, go to assembler.py. Here change the 'file' in main to whatever test-file you want to translate from assembly to logisim readable hex code. Mapping provided in documentation.

Go to logisim, go to the processor you want to test, load image 'output.hex' into Instruction Memory component. Click clock on/off to go through instructions, check results!
